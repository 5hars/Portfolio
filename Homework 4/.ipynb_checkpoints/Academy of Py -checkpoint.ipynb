    "Observable Trends:\n",
    "1. It appears that Charter schools tend to have a higher average score in all aspects when compared to District schools. More analysis needs to be done to find out why; if the higher averages are a result of how the school educates their students or if it is because of a smaller teacher to student ratio. There were only 15 schools used so a larger collection of data would yield better results.\n",
    "2. The school size did seem to matter with the smaller schools having higher scores which is more evident in the math scores. The larger schools were found more in the bottom five schools when compared to the schools in the top five of the data.\n",
    "3. The schools seem to do well regardless of their budget with scores similar throughout the math and reading scores."
